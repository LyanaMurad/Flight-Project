# Flight-Project
## Abstract:

This project focuses on enhancing the accuracy of flight delay reason classification using deep learning and machine learning techniques. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of flight delays and their contributing factors, we develop predictive models to identify the underlying reasons for delays. Utilizing neural networks and advanced ML algorithms, we aim to classify delay types into distinct categories, such as security, weather, and airline-related delays. Our approach integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to provide actionable insights for improving flight management and operational efficiency. This work contributes to more precise delay predictions, ultimately aiding in better decision-making and resource allocation in the aviation industry.

## Introduction About Data
### Overview
This dataset appears to be related to flight information, with each row representing a flight and various columns providing details about the flight's schedule, delays, and other attributes. Here's a breakdown of the important aspects:
•	Total Records: 1,048,575 non-null entries for most columns, indicating the dataset is large with over a million flights recorded.
•	Numerical Columns:
o	There are columns representing year, month, day, day of the week, and various numerical details such as flight numbers, scheduled times, actual times, and delays.
o	Notably, columns like departure time, departure delay, air time, and arrival time have some missing values, indicating that not all flights had complete data.
o	Columns for various types of delays (e.g., airline delay, security delay) have significant missing data, possibly because not every flight experienced delays.
•	Categorical Columns:
o	Airline, tail number, origin airport, and destination airport are stored as objects (strings), allowing identification of the flight and its route.
o	Cancellation reason has many missing values (with only 40,527 non-null entries), implying that most flights were not canceled.
•	Missing Data: Several columns have missing values, especially delay-related columns and departure/arrival times, which might require cleaning or imputation for further analysis.
•	Memory Usage: The dataset takes up around 248 MB in memory, which is typical for a dataset of this size.
This dataset could be useful for analyzing flight delays, cancellations, and general patterns in airline operations.

## Objective
The objective of analyzing this flight dataset is to gain insights into various aspects of airline operations, including:
1.	Flight Delays and Cancellations: To understand the patterns and causes of delays and cancellations, including the impact of different types of delays (e.g., airline delay, security delay, weather delay) on flight schedules.
2.	Operational Efficiency: To evaluate the efficiency of flight operations by examining time metrics such as departure delays, taxi times, and elapsed times.
3.	Scheduling Patterns: To identify trends in flight scheduling, including peak times for departures and arrivals, and how these  affects overall flight performance.
4.	Flight Patterns and Routes: To analyze flight routes, including common origins and destinations, and how these factors contribute to operational delays and efficiencies.
5.	Impact of External Factors: To assess how external factors such as weather and security impact flight operations and contribute to delays or cancellations.
6.	Data Quality and Completeness: To evaluate the completeness of the dataset and the presence of missing data, which may affect the accuracy of the analysis and require appropriate handling.
7.	Building a Predictive Model: To develop a predictive model capable of forecasting delay reasons flights and identifying the factors influencing cancellations, in order to improve planning and make more accurate decisions in flight management.
By achieving these objectives, the analysis aims to enhance understanding of flight operations, improve airline performance, increase customer satisfaction, and provide predictive tools to support better flight management.
