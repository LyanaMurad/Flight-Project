# FLIGHT DELAY REASON CLASSIFICATION
## Abstract:

This project focuses on enhancing the accuracy of flight delay reason classification using deep learning and machine learning techniques. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of flight delays and their contributing factors, we develop predictive models to identify the underlying reasons for delays. Utilizing neural networks and advanced ML algorithms, we aim to classify delay types into distinct categories, such as security, weather, and airline-related delays. Our approach integrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization to provide actionable insights for improving flight management and operational efficiency. This work contributes to more precise delay predictions, ultimately aiding in better decision-making and resource allocation in the aviation industry.

## Introduction About Data
### Overview
This dataset appears to be related to flight information, with each row representing a flight and various columns providing details about the flight's schedule, delays, and other attributes. Here's a breakdown of the important aspects:
•	Total Records: 1,048,575 non-null entries for most columns, indicating the dataset is large with over a million flights recorded.
•	Numerical Columns:
o	There are columns representing year, month, day, day of the week, and various numerical details such as flight numbers, scheduled times, actual times, and delays.
o	Notably, columns like departure time, departure delay, air time, and arrival time have some missing values, indicating that not all flights had complete data.
o	Columns for various types of delays (e.g., airline delay, security delay) have significant missing data, possibly because not every flight experienced delays.
•	Categorical Columns:
o	Airline, tail number, origin airport, and destination airport are stored as objects (strings), allowing identification of the flight and its route.
o	Cancellation reason has many missing values (with only 40,527 non-null entries), implying that most flights were not canceled.
•	Missing Data: Several columns have missing values, especially delay-related columns and departure/arrival times, which might require cleaning or imputation for further analysis.
•	Memory Usage: The dataset takes up around 248 MB in memory, which is typical for a dataset of this size.
This dataset could be useful for analyzing flight delays, cancellations, and general patterns in airline operations.

## Objective
The objective of analyzing this flight dataset is to gain insights into various aspects of airline operations, including:
1.	Flight Delays and Cancellations: To understand the patterns and causes of delays and cancellations, including the impact of different types of delays (e.g., airline delay, security delay, weather delay) on flight schedules.
2.	Operational Efficiency: To evaluate the efficiency of flight operations by examining time metrics such as departure delays, taxi times, and elapsed times.
3.	Scheduling Patterns: To identify trends in flight scheduling, including peak times for departures and arrivals, and how these  affects overall flight performance.
4.	Flight Patterns and Routes: To analyze flight routes, including common origins and destinations, and how these factors contribute to operational delays and efficiencies.
5.	Impact of External Factors: To assess how external factors such as weather and security impact flight operations and contribute to delays or cancellations.
6.	Data Quality and Completeness: To evaluate the completeness of the dataset and the presence of missing data, which may affect the accuracy of the analysis and require appropriate handling.
7.	Building a Predictive Model: To develop a predictive model capable of forecasting delay reasons flights and identifying the factors influencing cancellations, in order to improve planning and make more accurate decisions in flight management.
By achieving these objectives, the analysis aims to enhance understanding of flight operations, improve airline performance, increase customer satisfaction, and provide predictive tools to support better flight management.

## Usning Machine Learning and ANN
The performance of traditional machine learning models may be lower than that of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in some cases due to several key factors:
1.	Data Complexity
o	Traditional Machine Learning: Models like logistic regression or decision trees may struggle to capture complex interactions between features if the data contains nonlinear or intertwined relationships.
o	Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): ANNs can handle complex interactions and nonlinear patterns more effectively due to their ability to learn multi-layered representations of the data.
2.	Model Generalization
o	Traditional Machine Learning: Simpler models may be prone to underfitting, leading to poor performance if the data contains intricate patterns.
o	Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): ANNs can have many layers and neurons, allowing them to learn more complex features and better adapt to the data.
3.	Data Size
o	Traditional Machine Learning: Simple models might underperform if the dataset is large and complex.
o	Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): ANNs often perform better with large amounts of data, as they can leverage extensive training data to learn more precise patterns.
4.	Feature Engineering and Normalization
o	Traditional Machine Learning: Models may require extensive preprocessing and feature scaling to achieve good performance.
o	Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): ANNs can be more flexible in handling raw or poorly engineered features, thanks to their ability to automatically learn feature representations.
 ## note:
### I obtained a high accuracy of the model, but due to not saving the model and restarting the operation, unfortunately, the accuracy decreased to 76. Therefore, you will find in the PDF file that the accuracy of the model reached the nineties.
